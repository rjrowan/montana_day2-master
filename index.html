              <p>Nine months after returning home from a nine-month-long deployment to Iraq, Greg Morgan snapped out of it. He found himself sitting in the corner of his bedroom, wondering how he got there. In his arms, he was cradling an assault rifle.</p>
              <p>At first, it seemed his transition back into civilian life was going well, at least better than most veterans he knew. After serving as cavalry scout in the National Guard, he returned home and spent most of 2009 and 2010 at his parents’ house in Chardon, Ohio. He was surrounded by family, and he could keep his mind occupied with his dogs and horses.</p>
              <p>But after moving west to Oregon for school, his support system was gone.</p>

              <p>“It was just me, myself, my thoughts in a two bedroom apartment,” Morgan said. “When you come back from somewhere and things look out of place, you start freaking out.”</p>
              <p>There are nearly 22 million veterans in the U.S., according to estimates by the Department of Veteran Affairs. They are often asked to immediately assimilate back into civilian society. Some, like Morgan, are still coping with the burden of their experiences. Many enter the workforce in hopes of restoring a sense of normalcy, while others pursue higher education. The transition, however, is rife with complexities.</p>
              <p>Cradling his rifle that day in Oregon, Morgan realized something was wrong. He tried to stay active by getting outside to keep his life from spiraling out of control. He kept his mind busy and looked for ways to build back the support he needed.</p>
              <p>Oregon felt wrong, but Montana held promise. He knew a fellow veteran there he had competed with in the biathlon, and he wanted to surround himself with other veterans. He didn’t want to be cast in one of two Hollywood extremes: the war hero or the veteran unable to adjust to civilian life.</p>
              <p>Morgan enrolled at the University of Montana in the fall of 2014, the same semester the Residence Life Office debuted a Living Learning Community specifically for veterans. The idea was to group together students who had served in the military in the hope their shared experiences could unite them, and provide a network of support.</p>
